# VERILOG WORKSHOP

## SUMMARY

1. **UNIT OF STUDY** : Verilog
2. **OBJECTIVE** : Teach the basic concepts of Verilog HDLto prepare students for 2nd
    year courses and enable them to make a project basedon it.
3. **INSTRUCTOR** : Vishwas Baya, Sathvik Swaminathan, Dhruv Makwana
4. **TIME** : 5 live interactive sessions

## WHAT IS VERILOG?

Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) usedto model electronic systems.

Applied to electronic design, Verilog is intendedto be used for verification through

simulation, for timing analysis, for test analysis(testability analysis and fault grading) and

for logic synthesis.

## WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH VERILOG?

It is a language used for describing a digital systemlike a network switch or a

microprocessor or a memory or a flipâˆ’flop. It means,by using a HDL we can describe any

digital hardware at any level. Designs, which aredescribed in HDL are independent of

technology, very easy for designing and debugging,and are normally more useful than

schematics, particularly for large circuits.

It is used in courses like: 
**DIGITAL DESIGN**: CDC for ECE, EEE, ENI and CS.

## COURSE PLAN

Present in the handout section.

## MATERIAL AND RESOURCES

Resources corresponding to the topics covered in eachclass would be provided as the course

goes on for better understanding and further reading.


## ASSESSMENT

Final project needs to be completed to be eligiblefor the certificate.
